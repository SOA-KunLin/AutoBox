# AutoBox

### GitHub Corners

As in AutoDockTools, it provides you an UI to create a grid box, of which you can freely move the center and adjust the size (points). However, in AutoBox, you can even rotate the box!:satisfied:

It requires you uploaing a pdb file of a clear single chain structure, and it provides you a pdb file of a transformed structure and the configure lines corrisponding to the current grid box settings, which can be directly used in AutoDock and Vina software!:+1:

Since AutoDock and Vina only allow the grid box aligning the Cartesian coordinate axes, instead of rotating your grid box, what it really does, when pressing the "Download This Structure" button, is to automatically rotate your structure to fit the rotated angle you want your grid box to be! You can also press the "Apply" button to instantly see how your structure being rotated!:v:

Try it now!:point_down:
